Tapir/LLVM
================================

This directory and its subdirectories contain source code for
Tapir/LLVM, a prototype compiler based on LLVM that implements the
Tapir compiler IR extensions for fork-join parallelism.

Tapir/LLVM is under active development.  This directory contains
prototype implementations of compiler technologies that take advantage
of the Tapir compiler IR.

Tapir/LLVM is open source software.  You may freely distribute it
under the terms of the license agreement found in LICENSE.txt.
