/** @defgroup ReducersAnd Bitwise AND Reducers
 *
 *  Bitwise AND reducers allow the computation of the bitwise AND of a set of
 *  values in parallel.
 *
 *  @ingroup Reducers
 *
 *  You should be familiar with @ref pagereducers "Intel(R) Cilk(TM) Plus reducers",
 *  described in file `reducers.md`, and particularly with @ref reducers_using,
 *  before trying to use the information in this file.
 *
 *  @section redopand_usage Usage Example
 *
 *      cilk::reducer< cilk::op_and<unsigned> > r;
 *      cilk_for (int i = 0; i != N; ++i) {
 *          *r &= a[i];
 *      }
 *      unsigned result;
 *      r.move_out(result);
 *
 *  @section redopand_monoid The Monoid
 *
 *  @subsection redopand_monoid_values Value Set
 *
 *  The value set of a bitwise AND reducer is the set of values of `Type`,
 *  which is expected to be a builtin integer type which has a representation
 *  as a sequence of bits (or something like it, such as `bool` or
 *  `std::bitset`).
 *
 *  @subsection redopand_monoid_operator Operator
 *
 *  The bitwise AND operator is defined by the "`&`" binary operator on `Type`.
 *
 *  @subsection redopand_monoid_identity Identity
 *
 *  The identity value of the reducer is the value whose representation
 *  contains all 1-bits. This is expected to be the value of the expression
 *  `~Type()` (i.e., the bitwise negation operator applied to the default value
 *  of the value type).
 *
 *  @section redopand_operations Operations
 *
 *  @subsection redopand_constructors Constructors
 *
 *      reducer()   // identity
 *      reducer(const Type& value)
 *      reducer(move_in(Type& variable))
 *
 *  @subsection redopand_get_set Set and Get
 *
 *      r.set_value(const Type& value)
 *      const Type& = r.get_value() const
 *      r.move_in(Type& variable)
 *      r.move_out(Type& variable)
 *
 *  @subsection redopand_initial Initial Values
 *
 *  If a bitwise AND reducer is constructed without an explicit initial value,
 *  then its initial value will be its identity value, as long as `Type`
 *  satisfies the requirements of @ref redopand_types.
 *
 *  @subsection redopand_view_ops View Operations
 *
 *      *r &= a
 *      *r = *r & a
 *      *r = *r & a1 & a2 â€¦ & an
 *
 *  @section redopand_types Type and Operator Requirements
 *
 *  `Type` must be `Copy Constructible`, `Default Constructible`, and
 *  `Assignable`.
 *
 *  The operator "`&=`" must be defined on `Type`, with `x &= a` having the
 *  same meaning as `x = x & a`.
 *
 *  The expression `~ Type()` must be a valid expression which yields the
 *  identity value (the value of `Type` whose representation consists of all
 *  1-bits).
 *
 *  @section redopand_in_c Bitwise AND Reducers in C
 *
 *  The @ref CILK_C_REDUCER_OPAND and @ref CILK_C_REDUCER_OPAND_TYPE macros can
 *  be used to do bitwise AND reductions in C. For example:
 *
 *      CILK_C_REDUCER_OPAND(r, uint, ~0);
 *      CILK_C_REGISTER_REDUCER(r);
 *      cilk_for(int i = 0; i != n; ++i) {
 *          REDUCER_VIEW(r) &= a[i];
 *      }
 *      CILK_C_UNREGISTER_REDUCER(r);
 *      printf("The bitwise AND of the elements of a is %x\n", REDUCER_VIEW(r));
 *
 *  See @ref reducers_c_predefined.
