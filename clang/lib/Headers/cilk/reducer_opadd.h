/** @defgroup ReducersAdd Addition Reducers
 *
 *  Addition reducers allow the computation of the sum of a set of values in
 *  parallel.
 *
 *  @ingroup Reducers
 *
 *  You should be familiar with @ref pagereducers "Intel(R) Cilk(TM) Plus reducers",
 *  described in file `reducers.md`, and particularly with @ref reducers_using,
 *  before trying to use the information in this file.
 *
 *  @section redopadd_usage Usage Example
 *
 *      cilk::reducer< cilk::op_add<int> > r;
 *      cilk_for (int i = 0; i != N; ++i) {
 *          *r += a[i];
 *      }
 *      return r.get_value();
 *
 *  @section redopadd_monoid The Monoid
 *
 *  @subsection redopadd_monoid_values Value Set
 *
 *  The value set of an addition reducer is the set of values of `Type`, which
 *  is expected to be a builtin numeric type (or something like it, such as
 *  `std::complex`).
 *
 *  @subsection redopadd_monoid_operator Operator
 *
 *  The operator of an addition reducer is the addition operator, defined by
 *  the "`+`" binary operator on `Type`.
 *
 *  @subsection redopadd_monoid_identity Identity
 *
 *  The identity value of the reducer is the numeric value "`0`". This is
 *  expected to be the value of the default constructor `Type()`.
 *
 *  @section redopadd_operations Operations
 *
 *  @subsection redopadd_constructors Constructors
 *
 *      reducer()   // identity
 *      reducer(const Type& value)
 *      reducer(move_in(Type& variable))
 *
 *  @subsection redopadd_get_set Set and Get
 *
 *      r.set_value(const Type& value)
 *      const Type& = r.get_value() const
 *      r.move_in(Type& variable)
 *      r.move_out(Type& variable)
 *
 *  @subsection redopadd_initial Initial Values
 *
 *  If an addition reducer is constructed without an explicit initial value,
 *  then its initial value will be its identity value, as long as `Type`
 *  satisfies the requirements of @ref redopadd_types.
 *
 *  @subsection redopadd_view_ops View Operations
 *
 *      *r += a
 *      *r -= a
 *      ++*r
 *      --*r
 *      (*r)++
 *      (*r)--
 *      *r = *r + a
 *      *r = *r - a
 *      *r = *r ± a1 ± a2 … ± an
 *
 *  The post-increment and post-decrement operations do not return a value. (If
 *  they did, they would expose the value contained in the view, which is
 *  non-deterministic in the middle of a reduction.)
 *
 *  Note that subtraction operations are allowed on an addition reducer because
 *  subtraction is equivalent to addition with a negated operand. It is true
 *  that `(x - y) - z` is not equivalent to `x - (y - z)`, but
 *  `(x + (-y)) + (-z)` _is_ equivalent to `x + ((-y) + (-z))`.
 *
 *  @section redopadd_floating_point Issues with Floating-Point Types
 *
 *  Because of precision and round-off issues, floating-point addition is not
 *  really associative. For example, `(1e30 + -1e30) + 1 == 1`, but
 *  `1e30 + (-1e30 + 1) == 0`.
 *
 *  In many cases, this won't matter, but computations which have been
 *  carefully ordered to control round-off errors may not deal well with
 *  being reassociated. In general, you should be sure to understand the
 *  floating-point behavior of your program before doing any transformation
 *  that will reassociate its computations.
 *
 *  @section redopadd_types Type and Operator Requirements
 *
 *  `Type` must be `Copy Constructible`, `Default Constructible`, and
 *  `Assignable`.
 *
 *  The operator "`+=`" must be defined on `Type`, with `x += a` having the
 *  same meaning as `x = x + a`. In addition, if the code uses the "`-=`",
 *  pre-increment, post-increment, pre-decrement, or post-decrement operators,
 *  then the corresponding operators must be defined on `Type`.
 *
 *  The expression `Type()` must be a valid expression which yields the
 *  identity value (the value of `Type` whose numeric value is zero).
 *
 *  @section redopadd_in_c Addition Reducers in C
 *
 *  The @ref CILK_C_REDUCER_OPADD and @ref CILK_C_REDUCER_OPADD_TYPE macros can
 *  be used to do addition reductions in C. For example:
 *
 *      CILK_C_REDUCER_OPADD(r, double, 0);
 *      CILK_C_REGISTER_REDUCER(r);
 *      cilk_for(int i = 0; i != n; ++i) {
 *          REDUCER_VIEW(r) += a[i];
 *      }
 *      CILK_C_UNREGISTER_REDUCER(r);
 *      printf("The sum of the elements of a is %f\n", REDUCER_VIEW(r));
 *
 *  See @ref reducers_c_predefined.
